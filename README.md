# 🌸 Bloom Filter Implementation in Java 🌸

Welcome! This is a basic implementation of a Bloom Filter in Java. A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure that's super handy for checking if an element is a member of a set. It might give you false positives, but never false negatives. Cool, right? 😎

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's how you can get started with the Bloom Filter implementation:

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

You'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### 📥 Installation

1. First, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BloomFilter.git
   ```
2. Then, navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BloomFilter
   ```
3. Finally, compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac BloomFilter.java
    ```

That's it! You're all set to start using the Bloom Filter. Happy coding! 🎉
